Chordeon is a web app built with React and TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS, and powered by the Tone.js music library. It allows users to experiment with different audio loops, mixing and matching them to create their own unique versions of a song. The appâ€™s interactive interface makes it easy for anyone to explore musical creativity directly in the browser.
